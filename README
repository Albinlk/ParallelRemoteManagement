This project is a simple Python package with accompanying command-line
executable scripts for controlling many hosts (servers, machines, switches,
etc.) in parallel and with good error control. The package supports running
local commands, remote commands, local scripts on remote machines, pushing
files, and pulling files.

The included 'test.sh' uses all of the command-line executables. Just create
your own 'hosts.txt' with a list of valid remote machines and the test script
should work. Some changes might be needed if you don't have root access.
